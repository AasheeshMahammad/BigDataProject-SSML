# BigDataProject-SSML
### Information Regarding the Dataset :- Crime DataSet
1)The Train Dataset has a total of 9 columns and 878050 records.{Dates,Category,Descript,DayOfWeek,PdDistrict,Resolution,Address,X,Y}  
2)The Test Dataset has a total of 7columns and 884261 records.{Id,Dates,DayOfWeek,PdDistrict,Address,X,Y}     
3)The two datasets given have Dates,DayOfWeek,PdDistrict,Address,X,Y as the common attributes.    
  
### Problem Statement Identified from dataset  
Given the Common Features make Use of these features in order to predict the Category of crime committed given other set of attributes  
  
### Steps in completing this project:  
1)Fetching Data in Batches and PreProcessing  
2)Building Model  
3)Learning from train data  
4)Testing Your Model  
5)Clustering
